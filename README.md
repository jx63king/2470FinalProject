# 2710FinalProject
This is a final project for database management course in PITT


## Start DB
Make sure you have Docker installed. Use following command to start the DB on port `3306` with a GUI admin on `3307`. The mysql password is `example`.
```
docker-compose -f mysql.yml up
```

### At the moment, I don't have whole a lot of time to redo this project. In the end, I want to make this project to be a template, as it has the frontend/backend and the whole process. This would be a great example for anyone who wants to learn full-stack.
